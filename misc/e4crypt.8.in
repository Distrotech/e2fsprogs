.TH E4CRYPT 8 "Dec 2014" "e4crypt version 1"
.SH NAME
e4crypt \- ext4 filesystem encryption utility
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B e4crypt -[sgxW] [policy] path1 [path2 ... pathN]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B e4crypt
performs encryption management for ext4 file systems.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-s <policy> path1 [path2 ... pathN]"
Sets a policy for files/directories specified in path1 [path2 ... pathN].
Currently, all directories and files MUST be empty to set the policy.
Policy has the following format:
key_location1.key_description1#...#key_locationK.key_descriptionK,
where key_location is the search location for the key described by
key_description. Currently, key_location can be one of supported keyrings,
such as: @t, @p, @s, @g, @u, and @us. See
.BR keyctl (1)
for further details. Note, setting a policy over a file will fail without
.B -W
option.
.IP "-g path1 [path2 ... pathN]
Gets policy for all files/directories listed in the path1 - pathN options.
.IP "-p path1 [path2 ... pathN]
Removes encryption policy from files/directories listed in the path1 -
pathN options. Note, will fail to remove a policy from a non empty file or
directory.
.IP "-W ignore-danger"
This allows to set a policy over a file. Note, setting policy over a single
file might lead to inconsistency of policies in a directory and even to
disabling encryption alltogether. For instance, if a parent directory does not
have a policy, and there is an application, which uses temp files, so that it
copies temp file on exit over the original one, then extended attributes in
encryption name index will not be copied, i.e., encryption will be disabled.
That is why an explicit user consent is required to set policy over a file,
in order to avoid confusion.
